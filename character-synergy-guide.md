## Understanding Synergy Types

Hero synergies in Guards of Atlantis II fall into several categories:

### Mechanical Synergies
Direct card-to-card interactions where one hero's abilities explicitly enable another's.
- Example: Wuk places tree tokens (obstacles) that Cutter can grapple to.

### Role Complementarity
Heroes that cover each other's weaknesses by filling different roles.
- Example: A tank + sniper pairing where the tank holds the line while the sniper deals damage from safety.

### Tempo Synergies
Heroes whose initiative values and action timing complement each other.
- Example: A low-initiative hero setting up (placing tokens, debuffing) followed by a high-initiative hero exploiting the setup.

### Lane Pressure Synergies
Heroes that combine to push the minion wave effectively.
- Example: Minion manipulation + minion protection, or heroes that both excel at clearing enemy minions.

### Card Economy Synergies
Heroes that help manage the team's card economy (retrieval, forced discards on enemies).
- Example: A support hero retrieving an ally's discarded cards while a brawler pressures the enemy to discard.

---

## Strong Hero Pairings

### Tier 1: Exceptional Synergies

---

#### Wuk + Cutter — "Forest Grapple"
**Synergy type:** Mechanical + Zone Control

Wuk's **Mystic Saplings** places tree tokens that persist across rounds. These trees serve double duty:
1. They are obstacles that block enemy movement and fast travel.
2. Cutter's **Grappling Bolt** targets obstacles in a straight line and pulls her toward them — the more trees on the board, the more grapple points Cutter has across the entire map.

Wuk's attacks (**Nature's Protector/Guardian/Champion**) require targets to be adjacent to a tree token. Cutter's **Barrage/Bombardment/Broadside** forces discards on enemy heroes in radius who are adjacent to another enemy unit. Together, Wuk zones enemies near trees while Cutter punishes clustering and repositions freely using the forest network.

**Why it works:** Wuk is slow (Poor movement) but creates a web of trees. Cutter is highly mobile and turns those trees into a teleportation grid. Cutter covers Wuk's weakness (limited reach) and Wuk provides Cutter with the obstacle infrastructure she needs.

---

#### Cutter + Dodger — "Poke Comp"
**Synergy type:** Card Economy Pressure

Both Cutter and Dodger excel at forcing enemy heroes to discard cards from range. Cutter's **Barrage** → **Bombardment** → **Broadside** line and her **Brace for Impact** → **Ramming Speed** → **Crashland** line all force discards. Dodger's **Finger of Death** line gains massive bonus damage against heroes who already have cards in their discard, and **Dark Ritual** line generates coin advantage from empty spawn points.

When the enemy team lacks card retrieval (healing/sustain), this pairing grinds them down relentlessly. One hero forces the initial discard, then the other exploits the weakened hand state.

**Why it works:** Against teams with no sustain or card retrieval, this duo creates an oppressive card economy gap. The enemy is perpetually one card behind.

**Weakness:** Vulnerable to teams with strong card retrieval (Tali, Silverarrow, Wuk, Brogan's War Drummer/Master Skald).

---

#### Brogan + Sabina — "The Phalanx"
**Synergy type:** Role Complementarity + Lane Pressure

Brogan is the premier tank. His **Bulwark** prevents allies and friendly minions from being pushed/moved. His **Shield** → **Bolster** → **Fortify** line protects friendly minions from being killed. Sabina's entire kit revolves around minions: **Back to Back** gives +1 defense near friendly minions, **Command** → **Control** → **Tactical Advantage** moves friendly minions into optimal positions, **Basic Drill** → **Battle Drill** → **Field Promotion** makes minions count as ranged (or both melee and ranged) during attacks, and **Lead the Charge** → **Plot Armor** blocks attacks when near a friendly minion.

Together, Brogan keeps minions alive while Sabina weaponizes them. The minion wave becomes extremely difficult to clear and pushes reliably.

**Why it works:** Brogan solves Sabina's problem (minions dying before she can use them) and Sabina solves Brogan's problem (needing the push to actually convert). Brogan's **War Drummer/Master Skald** also retrieves cards for Sabina, keeping her hand healthy.

---

#### Xargatha + Tiger — "Catch and Kill"
**Synergy type:** Mechanical + Assassination

Xargatha's **Siren's Call** pulls enemies toward her. Her **Stone Gaze** → **Petrifying Stare** → **Turn into Statues** line immobilizes enemies. Her **Charming Aura** → **Aura of Control** → **Aura of Domination** line turns enemy minions friendly for defense calculations, and **Constrict** → **Deadly Embrace** pins adjacent heroes.

Tiger's **Backstab** line gains +2/+3 attack when a friendly unit is adjacent to the target. When Xargatha pulls and pins an enemy, Tiger gets guaranteed backstab bonus damage. Tiger's high initiative (13 on Blink Strike) lets him strike after Xargatha's setup. His **Blend into Shadows** grants immunity for next turn, letting him survive in dangerous positions.

**Why it works:** Xargatha creates kill setups that Tiger converts. Xargatha turns enemy minions "friendly" for defense calculations, which also counts for Tiger's backstab condition (a "friendly unit" adjacent to the target). The pull-lock-kill chain is devastating.

---

#### Tali + Silverarrow — "Frost and Arrows"
**Synergy type:** Card Economy + Zone Control

Tali's **Glacial Barrier** → **Wall of Frost** → **Pack Ice** places ice tokens that penalize enemy initiative (-1 per adjacent ice token). Her **Cold Snap** → **Snowstorm** → **Blizzard** line forces targeted card discards. Silverarrow's **Grasping Roots** → **Entangled Vines** → **Grappling Branches** line cripples enemy movement near terrain (ice tokens count as terrain/obstacles).

Silverarrow's **Snap Shot** → **Opportunity Shot** → **Clear Shot** line gets -2 range per unit adjacent to the target — Tali's ice tokens and freezing effects keep spaces clear around Silverarrow's targets. Silverarrow's **Fae Healing** → **Nature's Blessing** retrieves discarded cards for allies, and Tali's **Guardian Spirit** → **Vengeful Spirit** does the same, creating mutual sustain.

**Why it works:** Tali creates a hostile terrain environment that Silverarrow exploits. Ice tokens slow enemies (initiative penalty), root effects lock them in place (Silverarrow's Entangled Vines punishes adjacency to terrain), and both heroes provide card retrieval to keep each other alive.

---

### Tier 2: Strong Synergies

---

#### Garrus + Wasp — "The Wall"
**Synergy type:** Zone Control + Area Denial

Garrus's **Menace** → **Threaten** → **Terrify** pushes enemies out of his radius. His **Shields Up!** → **Form Testudo!** grants ranged immunity to all friendly units in radius. Wasp's **Static Barrier** prevents enemies from moving into or out of her radius. Her **Kinetic Repulse** → **Kinetic Blast** pushes all adjacent enemies.

Together they create an impenetrable zone: Garrus pushes enemies out, Wasp locks them out (or in). Garrus's **Chilling Howl** prevents fast travel and limits movement in radius, stacking with Wasp's movement restrictions.

**Why it works:** Two tanky heroes creating overlapping zones of denial. Enemies can't approach without eating discards, can't stay without being pushed, and can't retreat because of movement restrictions. Excellent at protecting a lane push.

---

#### Hanu + Any Slow Hero (Brogan, Wuk, Garrus) — "The Express"
**Synergy type:** Mechanical + Tempo

Hanu's **Hurry Up!** sets a hero's initiative to 11, letting slow tanks act early. His **This Way!** → **That Way!** moves both Hanu and an allied hero in a chosen direction (1-3 spaces). His **Hear Nothing** → **See Nothing** swaps with enemies to displace them.

Brogan (init 5-11), Wuk (init 4-8), and Garrus (init 1-10) all suffer from turns where they have low initiative and can't reach the fight in time. Hanu fixes this by boosting their initiative and physically repositioning them with coordinated movement.

**Why it works:** Slow heroes have powerful effects but often can't apply them because they act late and move slowly. Hanu solves both problems simultaneously. Hanu's **Ultimate (The Ultimate Trick)** lets him choose the action for the hero targeted by Hurry Up!, creating absurd combo potential.

---

#### Misa + Xargatha — "Immovable Force"
**Synergy type:** Tanking + Aggression

Misa's **Swoop In** taunts enemies in radius (they must attack Misa). She gains 2 coins whenever she discards a card while the taunt is active, turning enemy attacks into profit. Xargatha's **Siren's Call** pulls enemies into Misa's taunt radius, and her **Constrict/Deadly Embrace** pins them there.

Misa's **Watch Me Soar** grants immunity to non-ranged attacks and lets her fly through obstacles — perfect for repositioning after Xargatha's setup. Misa's **Focus** → **Discipline** → **Mastery** provides action repetition, making her taunt-and-punish cycle even stronger.

**Why it works:** Xargatha pulls and locks enemies; Misa taunts them so they can't ignore her. Misa profits from being attacked (coins), and Xargatha's **Backlash** chain lets her counter-attack when she discards for defense. Both heroes thrive in the thick of enemies.

---

#### Bain + Tiger — "Hunt and Execute"
**Synergy type:** Assassination + Card Economy

Bain's **Dead or Alive** places a bounty marker on a target hero — that hero spends 1 additional life counter when defeated. Bain's **Get Over Here!** pulls a target to him and prevents movement. Tiger then uses **Blink Strike** to pass through and strike, or **Backstab** for bonus damage if Bain is adjacent to the target.

Bain's **A Game of Chance** → **Dead Man's Hand** → **We're Not Done Yet!** forces facedown discards and generates coins. Tiger's **Pick Pocket** → **Master Thief** steals coins directly. Together, they starve the enemy of resources while threatening lethal damage on bounty-marked targets.

**Why it works:** Bain identifies and marks the highest-value target, Tiger executes it. The bounty marker makes kills cost the enemy team extra life counters. Tiger's blocks (**Dodge**, **Parry**, **Riposte**) keep him alive after diving in, and Bain's **Close Call** → **Narrow Escape** → **Perfect Getaway** blocks provide his own survivability.

---

#### Dodger + Whisper — "Death from the Shadows"
**Synergy type:** Lane Pressure + Assassination

Dodger's kit revolves around empty minion spawn points: **Dread Razor** gets +1 range near empty spawns, **Death Trap** forces discards on enemies near empty spawns, **Shield of Decay** gets +3 defense near empty spawns, and **Dark Ritual** generates coins from empty spawns. Whisper's **Cause Fear** → **Instill Dread** → **Strike Terror** pushes enemy minions off their spawn points, creating empty spawns for Dodger.

Whisper's **Blood Trail** → **Crimson Thirst** → **Sanguine Fury** gains bonus movement from empty spawn points. Whisper's **Shadow Step** → **Shadow Walk** → **Creeping Shadow** teleports to empty spawn points. Both heroes get stronger as minions die and spawn points empty.

**Why it works:** Whisper manipulates minion positions to create the empty-spawn-point conditions Dodger needs. Both heroes scale with the same board state (empty spawns), creating compounding advantage. Their combined pressure makes the minion wave nearly impossible to maintain.

---

#### Trinkets + Min — "Minefield Operator"
**Synergy type:** Mechanical + Zone Control

Trinkets places barrier tokens and a turret. Min places mine tokens, smoke bombs, and grenades. Min's **Poof!** → **Vanish** → **Ruse** swaps with mines, grenades, or smoke bombs in radius to block attacks. Trinkets' **Deployable Barrier** → **Deployable Bastion** places barriers that grant +1 defense per adjacent barrier token.

The board becomes a maze of tokens. Min's **Smoke Bomb** blocks line of sight for enemy ranged attacks. Trinkets' **Disruptor Jolt** → **Disruptor Pulse** → **Disruptor Grid** shuts down enemy skills in the turret's radius. Min's **Trip Mine** → **Cluster Mine** → **Mine Field** punishes enemy movement, and Trinkets' turret controls the zone.

**Why it works:** Both heroes are token-based controllers that create overlapping hazard zones. The token density gives Min more escape options (swap with any token) and Trinkets more infrastructure (turret + barriers). Enemies must navigate a gauntlet to engage.

---

#### Sabina + Whisper — "Push Machine"
**Synergy type:** Lane Pressure

Sabina's **Command** → **Control** → **Tactical Advantage** repositions friendly minions. Her **Basic Drill** → **Battle Drill** → **Field Promotion** makes friendly minions in radius count as ranged (or both melee and ranged). Whisper's **Cause Fear** → **Instill Dread** → **Strike Terror** pushes enemy minions, and **Lesser Evil** → **Greater Good** forces enemies to choose between discarding cards or letting Whisper kill minions.

Together they win every minion battle: Sabina buffs and positions friendly minions, Whisper displaces and kills enemy minions. The lane pushes relentlessly.

**Why it works:** Pure lane dominance. One hero strengthens your minion wave, the other weakens theirs. If the enemy doesn't commit heavy resources to the lane, you push to their throne.

---

#### Nebkher + Tali — "Mind Games"
**Synergy type:** Disruption + Card Economy

Nebkher's **Mind Grip** copies the primary action of an enemy hero's previously resolved card. His **Imbue Doubt** → **Time to Reconsider** → **An Illusion of Choice** forces enemies to swap their unresolved card with another, disrupting their planned turn. Tali's **Turn Into Ice** forces a hero to either retrieve their unresolved card or have a named-color card discarded.

Both heroes attack the enemy's hand and planning. Nebkher's **Fleeting Image** → **Multiple Projections** → **Master of Illusions** creates illusion tokens that let him teleport away when forced to discard, while Tali's **Glacial Barrier** → **Pack Ice** creates terrain that slows enemies. Together they make it nearly impossible for opponents to execute their game plan.

**Why it works:** Both heroes are disruptors that attack the decision space. Nebkher disrupts what card enemies want to play; Tali disrupts what they can do with it. The psychological pressure is immense — opponents never feel safe committing to a plan.

---

### Tier 3: Solid Synergies

| Pairing | Synergy Summary |
|---------|----------------|
| **Brogan + Arien** | Brogan's Bulwark prevents movement; Arien's Spell Break prevents skills. Complete lockdown. Arien's swap/teleport abilities reposition enemies into Brogan's range. |
| **Garrus + Ursafar** | Garrus forces enemies out of position with Terrify; enraged Ursafar chases them down. Garrus's Hold Ground/Make a Stand retrieves cards, keeping Ursafar's hand healthy for his aggressive playstyle. |
| **Silverarrow + Sabina** | Both provide support. Silverarrow snipes from distance while Sabina pushes the lane. Silverarrow's Fae Healing/Nature's Blessing retrieves Sabina's discarded cards. Sabina's minion positioning gives Silverarrow cleaner shots. |
| **Ignatia + Wasp** | Both have strong area control. Ignatia's magma tokens are obstacles; Wasp's Telekinesis/Mass Telekinesis moves units and tokens into optimal positions. Wasp can move Ignatia's magma tokens to block key paths. |
| **Swift + Bain** | Both are long-range damage dealers. Swift's **Snipe** (range 4) and **Killshot** (range 6!) combined with Bain's **Heavy Crossbow** (range 4) and **Impaler** (range 5) create a lethal crossfire. Bain's bounty marker makes Swift's kills cost extra life counters. |
| **Min + Tiger** | Both are melee initiators with escape tools. Min's smoke bombs block enemy ranged retaliation, protecting Tiger after a dive. Tiger's blocks (Dodge, Parry, Riposte) complement Min's token-swap defense (Poof/Vanish/Ruse). |
| **Wuk + Tali** | Both provide card retrieval (Wuk's Gifts of Nature, Tali's Guardian Spirit). Wuk's trees + Tali's ice tokens create a terrain-heavy board that feeds Silverarrow's Entangled Vines and limits enemy movement. Extremely durable duo. |
| **Hanu + Misa** | Hanu's Hurry Up! boosts Misa's initiative for earlier taunt deployment. Hanu's This Way!/That Way! repositions Misa into the perfect taunt position. Hanu's swap abilities (Unexpected Journey/There and Back Again) can extract Misa from danger after she tanks a round of attacks. |

## Weak Pairings and Anti-Synergies

These pairings have fundamental conflicts in their game plans or leave critical weaknesses unaddressed.

### Competing for the Same Space

| Pairing | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| **Tiger + Silverarrow** | Tiger needs to be adjacent to enemies to deal damage; Silverarrow needs to be far from enemies (Snap Shot loses range per adjacent unit). They pull the team in opposite directions and can't support each other's positioning. |
| **Swift + Silverarrow** | Two snipers with no frontline. Both are fragile and need distance. Neither can tank, control minions, or protect the other. One ranged threat is manageable; two with no tank is exploitable. |
| **Ursafar + Tiger** | Both are melee assassins who want to dive the same target. They compete for the "kill credit" and neither provides the setup the other needs. Both are fragile — if one is focused, the other can't protect them. |

### Plan Conflicts

| Pairing | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| **Dodger + Brogan** | Dodger wants empty minion spawn points (for damage, coins, and defense). Brogan wants to protect minions (Shield/Bolster/Fortify keep minions alive on spawn points). Brogan's entire protective kit works against Dodger's power condition. |
| **Dodger + Sabina** | Same issue — Sabina moves, buffs, and protects minions. Dodger wants those minions dead (and their spawn points empty). Their win conditions are fundamentally opposed. |
| **Whisper + Brogan** | Whisper pushes enemy minions around to create empty spawn points and thrives in chaos. Brogan wants a stable minion wave he can protect. Whisper's minion manipulation undermines Brogan's minion-protection plan. |
| **Nebkher + Nebkher-lite** | Nebkher copies enemy resolved cards, but gains no benefit from having a teammate with strong cards (he copies *enemies*). Paired with another hero who also doesn't directly interact with allies (like Ignatia), the team lacks cohesion. |

### Missing Key Capabilities

| Pairing | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| **Hanu + Tiger** | Both are slippery and evasive but neither is a strong damage dealer or lane pusher. Hanu's attacks are mediocre (1-4 base attack). Tiger deals conditional damage. Together they harass but rarely convert kills or push lanes. |
| **Tali + Dodger** | Tali's card-discard effects let enemies retrieve the card next turn. Dodger's Finger of Death line gains bonus damage against heroes with cards in their discard, but Tali's "temporary freeze" effect undermines sustained discard pressure because the cards come back. |
| **Min + Wuk** | Both are slow to set up (Min needs mines/smoke bombs, Wuk needs trees). Neither has long-range poke to hold the lane while setting up. A fast aggressive enemy team can overrun them before their infrastructure is online. |

---

## Counter-Matchups

Understanding who shuts down whom helps both in drafting and in-game target selection.

### Hard Counters

| Hero | Countered By | Why |
|------|-------------|-----|
| **Silverarrow** | **Garrus** | Garrus's Shields Up!/Form Testudo! grants ranged immunity to all units in radius — shuts down Silverarrow's entire kit. Garrus's Menace/Terrify pushes Silverarrow out of optimal range. |
| **Silverarrow** | **Tiger** | Tiger's Dodge/Sidestep/Evade blocks ranged attacks entirely. Tiger's high initiative (13) means he acts before Silverarrow can reposition. Tiger's mobility lets him close the gap and force melee combat where Silverarrow is weakest. |
| **Dodger** | **Tali** | Tali's Guardian Spirit/Vengeful Spirit retrieves discarded cards for allies, undoing Dodger's discard pressure. Tali's Ancestral Totem/Venerated Totem protects minions from dying, preventing Dodger's empty-spawn-point conditions. |
| **Tiger** | **Wasp** | Wasp's Static Barrier prevents Tiger from moving in or out of radius — trapping him or locking him out. Wasp's Dazzling Daggers cancels active skill effects (like Tiger's Blend into Shadows immunity). Wasp's Electroblast forces discards on secondary targets, punishing Tiger for being near his attack target. |
| **Trinkets** | **Misa** | Misa's extreme mobility (Movement 5 on Watch Me Soar, straight-line movement through obstacles) lets her bypass Trinkets' barrier and turret zone entirely. Misa ignores the token infrastructure. |
| **Nebkher** | **Min** | Min's Smoke Bomb blocks straight-line targeting, disrupting Nebkher's Mind Grip (which requires resolved cards of enemies in range). Min's high initiative (13) and mobility let him avoid Nebkher's disruption window. |
| **Hanu** | **Garrus** | Garrus's **Death Grip** (Ultimate) pins an adjacent hero in place — Hanu can't swap, can't escape, can't reposition. Garrus's raw melee damage overwhelms Hanu's poor combat stats. |
| **Wuk** | **Ignatia** | Ignatia's RED-side Scorching Blaze moves enemy units in radius up to 2 spaces, displacing Wuk away from his trees. Ignatia's magma tokens contest Wuk's tree placement, and Unstable Portal/Chaos Gate swaps can pull Wuk out of his forest. |

### Soft Counters

| Hero | Countered By | Why |
|------|-------------|-----|
| **Brogan** | **Xargatha** | Xargatha's Siren's Call pulls units toward her, partially bypassing Brogan's Bulwark (which prevents *enemy* pushing/moving of friendlies). Xargatha's Dangerous Slash/Deadly Swipe/Lethal Spin gains more attack per adjacent enemy — Brogan is often surrounded by minions, powering up Xargatha. |
| **Sabina** | **Wasp** | Wasp's Kinetic Repulse/Kinetic Blast pushes all adjacent units away, scattering the minion formations Sabina carefully builds. Static Barrier locks minions in place, preventing Sabina's Command/Tactical Advantage from repositioning them. |
| **Misa** | **Bain** | Bain's bounty marker makes Misa's risky taunt playstyle even more punishing if she dies — spending extra life counters. Bain's long-range crossbow can hit Misa from outside taunt radius. |
| **Ursafar** | **Arien** | Arien's Spell Break prevents skills, limiting Ursafar's ability to enter/maintain enraged state with non-attack cards. Arien's Slippery Ground/Deluge restricts movement in radius, limiting enraged Ursafar's charge potential. |
| **Swift** | **Min** | Min's Smoke Bomb blocks straight-line targeting, and Swift's Snipe/Prepared Shot/Killshot all require straight-line shots. One well-placed smoke bomb can shut down Swift's best attacks. |
| **Cutter** | **Garrus** | Garrus's area denial (Menace/Terrify) and Death Grip lock down mobile heroes. Cutter relies on grappling to obstacles and dash movement — Garrus punishes her for coming in. |

---

## Team Composition Archetypes

For 3v3 (6-player) games, successful teams generally follow one of these patterns.

### 1. The Deathball — "Group Up and Push"
**Core idea:** Stay together, protect minions, win every minion battle, push to the enemy throne.

| Role | Best Picks | Job |
|------|-----------|-----|
| Tank/Protector | Brogan, Garrus, Wuk | Protect minions, absorb damage, zone enemies |
| Pusher/Support | Sabina, Tali, Silverarrow | Buff minions, retrieve cards, sustain the team |
| Brawler/Carry | Arien, Wasp, Xargatha | Deal damage, punish enemies who contest the push |

**Example comp:** Brogan + Sabina + Wasp
- Brogan protects minions with Shield/Bolster/Fortify
- Sabina commands minions into optimal positions and makes them count as ranged
- Wasp zones enemies away with Static Barrier and punishes those who get too close

**Weakness:** Vulnerable to split-push strategies and long-range poke. If the enemy can force fights away from the minion wave, the Deathball loses its advantage.

---

### 2. The Pick Comp — "Find a Kill, Win the Fight"
**Core idea:** Isolate and eliminate a key enemy hero, then exploit the numbers advantage.

| Role | Best Picks | Job |
|------|-----------|-----|
| Initiator/Setup | Xargatha, Bain, Cutter, Hanu | Pull, stun, or displace a target |
| Assassin/Carry | Tiger, Ursafar, Misa, Whisper | Kill the isolated target |
| Support/Follow-up | Tali, Silverarrow, Wasp | Provide sustain, secondary damage, or more lockdown |

**Example comp:** Xargatha + Tiger + Tali
- Xargatha pulls an enemy with Siren's Call and pins them with Constrict/Deadly Embrace
- Tiger dives in with Blink Strike and Backstabs the immobilized target
- Tali provides card retrieval for Tiger/Xargatha and freezes a second enemy with Cold Snap/Snowstorm

**Weakness:** If the initiation fails or is blocked, the team has committed resources for nothing. Requires good timing and coordination.

---

### 3. The Poke Comp — "Death by a Thousand Cuts"
**Core idea:** Force discards from range until the enemy can't defend, then punish.

| Role | Best Picks | Job |
|------|-----------|-----|
| Ranged Poker | Cutter, Dodger, Swift, Bain | Force discards from safe range |
| Controller | Wasp, Trinkets, Nebkher | Restrict enemy movement and options |
| Finisher | Whisper, Ignatia, Silverarrow | Convert the card advantage into kills or pushes |

**Example comp:** Cutter + Dodger + Wasp
- Cutter and Dodger force discards from range every turn
- Wasp's Static Barrier prevents enemies from closing the gap
- Once enemies are out of cards, any attack becomes lethal

**Weakness:** Struggles against teams with strong card retrieval (Tali, Brogan, Wuk, Silverarrow). If the enemy can heal through the poke damage, this comp runs out of steam.

---

### 4. The Split Push — "Be Everywhere"
**Core idea:** Use high-mobility heroes to pressure multiple zones simultaneously.

| Role | Best Picks | Job |
|------|-----------|-----|
| Mobile Threat | Tiger, Misa, Cutter, Hanu | Create pressure in multiple zones, force responses |
| Lane Pusher | Sabina, Whisper, Dodger | Focus on winning the minion wave |
| Flexible | Min, Ignatia, Silverarrow | Rotate between supporting the split and helping the lane |

**Example comp:** Tiger + Sabina + Misa
- Tiger threatens flanks with Blink Strike and coin stealing
- Sabina pushes the lane with minion control
- Misa's extreme mobility lets her taunt in the lane or join Tiger's flank

**Weakness:** Requires strong game sense to know when to split and when to group. If caught individually, mobile heroes are often fragile.

---

### 5. The Fortress — "You Shall Not Pass"
**Core idea:** Create an impenetrable zone around the minion wave and grind out the win.

| Role | Best Picks | Job |
|------|-----------|-----|
| Zone Controller | Trinkets, Wuk, Wasp | Fill the board with tokens and terrain |
| Tank | Brogan, Garrus | Stand in the way, protect everything |
| Support/Healer | Tali, Silverarrow, Sabina | Keep the team's cards flowing |

**Example comp:** Wuk + Trinkets + Tali
- Wuk fills the board with trees; Trinkets adds turret, barriers
- Tali adds ice tokens and totem tokens for minion protection
- The token density makes the zone nearly impenetrable
- All three heroes have card retrieval, creating incredible sustain

**Weakness:** Slow to set up. Aggressive teams can rush before the Fortress is built. Also weak to heroes who ignore obstacles (Misa's Watch Me Soar, Cutter's Grappling Bolt).

---

## Draft Strategy Tips

### First-Pick Priority
Heroes who are strong regardless of team composition:
1. **Wasp** — Versatile controller/brawler, good stats, fits any team
2. **Brogan** — Best pure tank, strong in any comp
3. **Xargatha** — Versatile brawler with pull, lockdown, and aura abilities
4. **Tali** — Best overall support, enables nearly every ally

### Flex Picks (Adapt to What You Need)
- Need ranged damage? → **Swift**, **Silverarrow**, or **Bain**
- Need assassination? → **Tiger**, **Ursafar**, or **Whisper**
- Need more control? → **Garrus**, **Trinkets**, or **Nebkher**
- Need mobility? → **Misa**, **Cutter**, or **Hanu**

### Draft Traps to Avoid
- **Three melee heroes with no range** — The enemy will kite you forever.
- **Three snipers with no frontline** — One aggressive dive shuts you down.
- **No card retrieval on the team** — You'll run out of cards mid-round and can't defend.
- **All-in on one strategy** — If the enemy counters your single plan, you have no backup.

### The Golden Rule
A balanced team has:
1. **At least one frontliner** (tank or brawler) who can stand near minions
2. **At least one source of card retrieval** (support or self-sustain hero)
3. **At least one ranged threat** to prevent the enemy from turtling
