## Lore

*Some say there are players who like story in their games. Some say there are even those who like there to be a story in their MOBA game. If you are one of those players, it's on you. You made me do this :) Behold — the inevitable Lore section!*

### The Minions

In ancient times, the war between Atlantis and the Titans ended with the 'Turning of the Sacred Valve,' and let's just say it didn't end well.

The minions were the foot soldiers of that ancient war. Whether created by the magic of the Titans, or crafted by the Atlantean artificers of old, their purpose was the same — to do all the dying on behalf of their masters.

Thousands of years later, with their creators long gone, the minions stayed true to their purpose, locked in an endless struggle against their counterparts. They would have long since wiped each other out, but the Thrones keep spewing out new minions as wave after wave gets destroyed.

That, of course, means that I have no shortage of spare parts. Pass me that wrench, will ya?

> *— Trinkets the Scavenger*

### The Thrones

"The minions aren't the only artifacts of that bygone age. Scattered across the continent are the mysterious installations of the ancients, which everyone just calls 'Thrones.'

No one really knows what they were built for, but the minions seem particularly intent on destroying those of the 'wrong color.' The good news is that when they succeed, there's usually a treasure — or a huge explosion. There's no way to tell in advance, really.

What will happen when all of them are destroyed? I've never given it much thought. Now stop fooling around and give me a hand! This vault won't open itself!"

> *— Tigerclaw the Cutpurse*

### The Heroes

Have you noticed how they always have an excuse? Whether it's some 'higher calling,' a matter of honor, a quest for knowledge, or whatever.

But in the end, they don't even care which side they fight for. Bah! If you ask me, they're little more than grave robbers, these so-called 'heroes.'

Me? No, I'm nothing like them — I'm in this for the money!

> *— Bain the Bounty Hunter*

## Overview

### Heroes

In *Guards of Atlantis II*, each player is represented by a single hero. Heroes differ vastly from one another in their abilities, playstyle, and complexity.

Over the course of the game, heroes collect coins and spend them to upgrade their starting abilities and obtain new ones, becoming increasingly powerful.

### Teams

Heroes are split into two opposing teams: one fighting for the Atlanteans (Red) and the other fighting for the Titans (Blue). Regardless of which side you are on, coordinating with your team mates is the key to victory.

The recommended way to play is with either 4 or 6 players.

While there are ways to play *Guards of Atlantis II* with up to 10 players or with an odd number of players, these player counts should only be used if all participants have played the game at least five times.

### Zones and Thrones

The board is covered by a hex grid and divided into Zones. The two most important Zones are the two Thrones, one for each team.

The Throne is where your hero starts the game and where they respawn when defeated. Capturing the enemy Throne is the quickest (but not the easiest) way to win.

### Minions

Minions are another type of unit. Unlike heroes, they are not directly controlled by the players.

Minions automatically fight other minions between rounds and will not attack heroes, though they can affect your hero's defense if you get too close, so be cautious!

Minions serve as cannon fodder for the heroes and as a source of steady income of coins and level ups! While minions are no match for a hero, only minions can capture the enemy Throne by "Pushing a Lane".

### Battle Zone and "Pushing a Lane"

A Lane is a sequence of Zones connecting the two Thrones. At the start of the game, all minions are placed in the Zone in the middle of the Lane, called the Battle Zone.

If all opposing minions are destroyed, your minions advance one Zone closer to the enemy Throne, and that Zone becomes the new Battle Zone. Defeated minions respawn in the new Battle Zone, and the fight continues — this is called "Pushing the Lane".

If your minions ever Push the Lane into the enemy Throne, they capture it and your team wins!

### Action Cards

Cards are the heart of *Guards of Atlantis II*. Everything your hero can do — skills, attacks and even your hero's "health" — is represented by an action on a card. If a card's text directly contradicts the rules, the card's text takes precedence.

You play 1 Action card each turn (simultaneously with other players) to perform 1 action. After 4 turns, the round ends, and you retrieve all your cards to use again in the next round.

### Read All the Cards Carefully!

There are many unique cards and card interactions to explore, which can feel overwhelming at first. But do not worry! If you are ever unsure about an effect or interaction, simply **follow the card text exactly as written**.

The cards are written with precision, and many points of confusion can be resolved by rereading the text. Additional clarifications on core concepts and keywords are available in the [Concepts and Keywords](#concepts-and-keywords) section.

### Defeating Enemy Heroes

In addition to Pushing Lanes and defeating minions, it's every hero's right and privilege to fight and defeat their peers using a vast array of deadly attacks.

If your hero is defeated, they respawn at their Throne, safe and sound. However, immortality comes at a cost: the attacker and their team earn coins for your defeat, and, more importantly, your team loses one or more Life counters.

Life counters are shared by your team. If you spend your last Life counter, the enemy team wins the game, so try not to die (or, at least not too often)!

Higher-level heroes are worth more coins and spend more Life counters when defeated. If you fall behind, there is always a chance for an epic comeback!

### Last Push

The game also ends when "time" runs out. Whenever a team Pushes the Lane, a Wave counter is removed. When the last counter is gone, the game ends immediately, and the team that won the last Push wins the game!

### Line of Sight

There are no "line of sight" rules! You can simply see everything!

### Table Talk

*Guards of Atlantis II* has strict rules for communication during the game. Following them ensures that the game is played as intended and runs smoothly. Several heroes are designed and balanced with these rules in mind.

**Between turns:** You are free to discuss strategy with your team, but it must be done out loud so that the other team can clearly hear you. You are not allowed to take notes or show each other cards (though you may read aloud information from your cards).

**Once cards are revealed:** Strategy discussions must stop. Players should read the cards played by others to gauge their opponents' and teammates' intentions, but each player must make decisions on their own.

If teammates need to make a coordinated decision after cards are revealed, they must do so without discussing strategy; they may simply state their preferences.

> It would be legal for one player to say "I would really like you to go first", but not "I need to go first, because I have to dodge that attack". Players must come to an agreement without discussing their rationale.

If a card instructs another player on your team to name a color or choose a direction, you are not allowed to suggest which option you would like them to choose.

### Hidden Information

You can always ask another player to read any of their unresolved cards, resolved cards, and discarded cards, as well as visible information on their dashboards.

Everything else is hidden information, including:
- Cards in the deck
- Cards in hand
- The part of the card covered by your hero dashboard
- Any facedown cards

Not knowing or not being 100% certain of the exact values and the exact text of every card is expected and is a part of the game.

> *Exceptions can be made for first-time players. More experienced players are encouraged to reveal information, such as their initiative, attack, or defense value, to newer players during a teaching game.*

---

## Game Setup (4 or 6 players)

1. **Place the Board** — Take the board and place it as shown.

2. **Split into Two Equal Teams** — One team is "Team Red" and the other is "Team Blue".

3. **Place the Tie Breaker Coin** — Flip it in the air, place it result side up near the corner of the board.

4. **Place the Wave Counters** — Based on desired game length:
   - Quick game: 3 Wave counters
   - Long game: 5 Wave counters

5. **Place the Life Counters** — Based on player count and game length:

   | Player Count | Quick game | Long game |
   |-------------|-----------|-----------|
   | 4 Players | 4 | 6 |
   | 6 Players | 5 | 8 |

   Place them on the corresponding Throne with "unspent" side up.

6. **Place the Coins** — Within reach of all players.

7. **Distribute Hero Dashboards**
   - **4 players:** Red team gets "Wasp the Warmaiden" and "Xargatha the Changed". Blue team gets "Arien the Tidemaster" and "Brogan the Destroyer".
   - **6 players:** Add "Tigerclaw the Cutpurse" (Red) and "Sabina the Gunslinger" (Blue).

8. **Place the Level Indicator Cards** — Each player tucks one under the left edge of their dashboard at Level 1.

9. **Place Hero Miniatures** — Attach colored bases. Place heroes on spawn points in their Throne Zone.

10. **Place Minion Miniatures** — Place on matching spawn points in the starting Battle Zone:
    - Each team: 1x Ranged, 4x Melee, 1x Heavy

11. **Prepare Cards, Tokens and Markers**
    - Each player takes their hero's 18-card deck
    - Find the 3 Tier I cards and 2 basic cards (no Tier) — these are your 5 starting cards
    - Return remaining Tier II, III, IV cards to your deck
    - Return the Handicap card ("H" Tier) to the box
    - Take any Tokens and Markers your hero uses

> *You never draw cards from your deck, so there is no need to shuffle it.*

## Game Structure

### Round Structure

The game is split into rounds. Each round consists of **four turns**. On each turn, all players select and play one card simultaneously, then resolve them, one by one, in the initiative order.

After four turns, the round ends, players take their cards back into their hand, and a new round begins.

### Turn Sequence

#### Play One Card
This part of the game is simultaneous. Select and play one Action card from your hand **Facedown** on any clear area of the game board.

You're only choosing the card for now. You will get to choose the action later.

You must play a card, if able. You must play a card even if your hero is not on the board. If you have no cards left, announce that you are passing.

Once all players have played a card Facedown or passed, reveal the cards by flipping them Faceup.

#### Check the Initiative
The Initiative is the number in the top left corner of the Action card. Highest Initiative acts first, then next highest, and so on. Ties are broken by the Tie Breaker coin.

**Tied Initiative:**
- **Different teams tied:** The team whose symbol is on the Tie Breaker coin goes first. After resolving, that player flips the coin.
- **Same team tied:** Players agree who goes first (without discussing strategy). Do not flip the coin.

#### Perform One Action
When it is your time to act, choose **one and only one** of the available actions to perform.

> *The Defense action is an exception to this rule.*

Each card has one **Primary action** and one or more **secondary actions**. **The card text must be applied when, and only when, performing the Primary action!**

**Primary Action Icons** (always match the card's color):
Attack, Skill, Defense or Skill, Movement, Defense

**Secondary Action Icons:**
Movement, Defense

Some secondary actions (Hold, Fast Travel, Clear) are not represented by icons.

#### Hero Respawn
If your hero is not on the board, you may choose to respawn on any empty Spawn point in your Throne Zone **before** performing an action. You may also choose not to respawn and resolve your card without performing an action.

#### Resolve Your Card
After you perform your one action, place your card Faceup on the current Turn slot of your hero dashboard — the card is now **resolved**.

If a card has an Active effect (e.g., "This Turn:"), turn it on its side.

#### Turn Ends
If you were the last player with an unresolved card, the turn ends. All active "This Turn" effects are canceled.

If this is the end of turn 4, the round ends — follow the End of Round steps. Otherwise, start another turn.

---

## End of Round

### Minion Battle
Count the number of minions each team has in the Battle Zone.
- Same number → No effect.
- Unequal → The team with fewer minions removes minions (of their choice) equal to the difference. The Heavy minion must be removed last!

### Remove Tokens, Return Markers
Remove all tokens from the board. Return all markers to supply.

### Push the Lane
As soon as one team loses their last minion, the Lane is pushed. The team with remaining minions wins the push.

1. Flip one Wave counter face-down. **Last counter flipped = that team wins the game.**
2. The next Zone toward the losing team's Throne becomes the new Battle Zone. **If it's the enemy Throne Zone = pushing team wins.**
3. Remove all minions in the previous Battle Zone. Respawn one minion of matching type in each Spawn point in the new Battle Zone.

> A Lane can be Pushed both at end of round and in the middle of a turn. If you defeat the last enemy minion mid-turn, the Lane pushes immediately.

> **Note:** A Lane Push can never be triggered by moving, pushing, or swapping a minion. It must be defeated or removed.

### Retrieve Cards
Take back into your hand all your resolved and discarded cards. This cancels all your Active effects, including "Next Turn" effects.

### Level Up
If you have enough coins to buy one or more level ups, you must do so now. (See [Leveling Up](#leveling-up).)

### Collect a Pity Coin
All players who have NOT leveled up this round collect 1 coin. You do not get to level up this round, even if you now have enough coins.

---

## Performing Actions & Card States

### Performing Actions

**Mandatory and Optional Steps:** Card text must be applied in exact order. If you can't complete a mandatory step, stop there. Steps with "you may", "up to", "if able" are optional.

**Making Choices:** You make all choices unless the card tells another hero to choose.

**Picking Targets:** Must choose valid targets based on card text, Range/Radius, and immunity. Your actions can affect you, other heroes, minions, tokens, and spaces.

> "A hero in range" and "Target a hero in range" mean the same thing.

**Modal Actions (Bullet Points):** Choose a bullet point, apply its text, ignore the rest. You may be able to choose multiple options.

**Repeat (Once / Up to X times):** After performing the action, you may perform it again up to the listed number of times. You cannot repeat a repeated action.

### Card States

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **In Hand** | At the start of the round, your cards are in your hand |
| **Played** | When placed facedown from hand onto the board |
| **Unresolved** | A played card before you perform its action |
| **Resolved** | After performing an action, placed on dashboard |
| **Discarded** | Placed in the discard pile |

### Changing Card State

- **Discard:** Put into the discard pile. Unless specified, discard from hand. Defense always discards from hand. Discarded cards are open information.
- **Retrieve:** Take a card back into your hand. All cards are retrieved at end of round.
- **Swap:** Two cards swap all their states.
- **Facedown:** Loses type, color, and actions. Hidden information. Cancel Active effect.

---

## Movement Action

When you perform a Movement action, move your hero up to the number of spaces on the movement icon.

**Units cannot move through or into spaces with obstacles** (heroes, minions, terrain, tokens).

### Movement as Primary Action
Apply the card text **in addition** to moving. Card text applies even if you move zero spaces. Unless stated otherwise, card text applies before movement.

### Movement in the Card Text
Some actions instruct you to move via card text. Same rules except:
- Cannot be used to Fast Travel
- Movement-preventing effects don't apply
- Unless optional, you must move the exact number of spaces

### Fast Travel Action (Replaces Movement)
You may perform **one** Fast Travel instead of your entire Movement action. Move to any space in the same Zone or an adjacent Zone, as long as:

- The destination is in the same Zone or an adjacent Zone
- **No enemy** heroes or minions in the Zone you're leaving
- **No enemy** heroes or minions in the Zone you're arriving in

> *Blocking the enemy from Fast Traveling is one of the key strategies. Avoid using your Red and Gold cards to Fast Travel.*

- Only one Fast Travel per action, regardless of movement value
- If replacing a primary movement, card text is NOT applied
- You don't need a path of empty spaces — just zone adjacency
- "Move" in card text cannot be Fast Travel; "perform a Movement action" can be

---

## Skill Action & Hold Action

### Skill Action
When you perform a Skill action, simply apply the card text. A Skill action is always the Primary action.

> Remember! You may only resolve one action on the card!

### Hold Action
Not represented by an icon. You can choose to perform a Hold action when resolving any card. When you Hold, you simply do nothing.

> Since you can Hold with any card, you are **never forced** to perform an action you don't want to.

---

## Attack Action

You may attack enemy heroes and minions by performing an Attack action. Most Attacks are Primary actions — apply the card text.

- "Before the Attack" text applies at the very beginning
- "After the Attack" text applies at the very end
- You can **never** attack or defeat friendly heroes and minions
- **Non-Ranged:** Can only target adjacent units
- **Ranged:** Can target based on the Range value

### Clear Action (Replaces Attack)
You may perform one Clear secondary action instead of your entire Attack. Remove any number of tokens adjacent to you.

### Attacking a Minion
Minions cannot defend. Target → defeated → collect coins → removed.
- Melee and Ranged minions: 2 coins
- Heavy minions: 4 coins (but protected by immunity)

When the last minion on either side is removed, the Lane is pushed immediately.

### Heavy Minion Immunity
As long as there are any friendly non-heavy minions in the Battle Zone, the heavy minion is **Immune** and can't be affected by any actions. You must defeat the other minions first.

### Attacking a Hero

**Calculate Your Attack Total:**
- Attack value on your card
- +1 for every Attack item you have
- +/- Attack from the card text, if any

Announce your total. The attacked hero gets a chance to defend. If they can't or choose not to, they are defeated.

**When a Hero is Defeated:**
- Remove the defeated hero from the board
- Unresolved card is resolved without performing an action
- Active effects canceled, markers returned
- Attacker collects coins equal to the hero's level
- Friendly heroes collect assist coins based on defeated hero's lowest card Tier
- Defeated hero's team spends Life counters equal to lowest card Tier

| Hero Level | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
|-----------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Lowest card Tier | I | I | I | II | II | II | III | III |
| Coins (Defeat) | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
| Assist Coins | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 3 |

---

## Defense Action

When attacked, you may reveal exactly one card from your hand and discard it to perform its Defense action.

**Key differences from other actions:**
- Cannot be performed on an already played card — only by discarding from hand
- Does NOT count toward your 1 card per turn limit — defend every attack as long as you have cards

### Calculate Your Defense Total
- Defense value on your card
- + Bonus defense from card text, if any
- +1 for every Defense item you have
- + Minion defense modifiers

**Minion Defense Modifiers:**
- +1 for every adjacent friendly melee or heavy minion
- -1 for every adjacent enemy melee or heavy minion
- -1 for every enemy ranged minion in radius of 2 spaces

**Defense >= Attack Total → Defended!**

You cannot defend without discarding a card. If you cannot defend successfully or choose not to, you are defeated.

### Defense/Skill Cards
Cards with the Defense/Skill icon can be used as either a Skill card (by playing it) or a Defense card (by discarding it). Card text applies either way.

### Block
Defense cards with an exclamation mark allow you to Block by fulfilling a condition in the card text. If fulfilled, you defend regardless of attack value.

### Attack/Defense Detailed Order
1. Attacker applies "Before the attack" text, if any
2. Calculate minion defense modifier
3. Defender may reveal and discard a card
4. Defender applies Defense action text, if any
5. Calculate the Defense total
6. Check if attack was successful; if so, remove the defending hero
7. Apply "After the attack:" text, if any
8. Defense action ends
9. Attack action ends

---

## Leveling Up

Your hero starts at level 1. When you collect enough coins, you **must** purchase a level up at the end of each round.

| Hero Level | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
|-----------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Level Up cost | - | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
| Max card Tier | - | II | II | II | III | III | III | IV |

You cannot skip a level. If you have enough coins for multiple level ups, you must purchase as many as you can afford.

> *You must upgrade all non-basic cards to Tier II before upgrading to Tier III.*

### Upgrade a Card
1. Choose a non-basic card in your hand with the lowest Tier (or tied for lowest). Return it to your deck.
2. Find the two cards of the same color that are one Tier higher.
3. Take one into your hand. Set the other aside Facedown.
4. If leveling up multiple times, repeat for each level.

You should end up with exactly 5 cards (1 of each color) in your hand.

### Gain an Item
Take each card set aside during upgrading and tuck it Faceup under your hero dashboard, under the slot with a matching Item icon.

Items must be clearly visible to the opposing team.

### Item Bonus
Each item increases the value of the matching icon on each of your Action cards by **+1**.

- No matching icon on a card → no effect on that card
- Items never affect card text values — only icon values (Initiative, Attack, Defense, Movement, Range, Radius)

### The Ultimate
Once all cards are Tier III, the next level-up unlocks the Ultimate (Tier IV). It's a permanent ability always in effect while your hero is on the board. Place it Faceup to the left of your dashboard.

After unlocking the Ultimate, you cannot gain additional levels but can still gain coins.

## Extended Player Counts

> *None of these options are beginner friendly.*

### 2 Players
Both players control two heroes each. Use 4-player setup. More challenging, takes longer.

### 8 or 10 Players
Use the double-lane map.

### Odd Number of Players

**Handicap Cards:** Each hero has an "H" card — a weaker version of a basic card (usually Gold).

- **5, 7, or 9 players:** Each player controls one hero. The team with more players replaces one basic card with a handicap card on each hero.
- **3 players:** Two play normally. The third (most experienced) controls two heroes and replaces one Gold card with a handicap.
- **3 or 5 players:** Use 4-player life counter count.

### Playing on a Double-Lane Map

The double-lane map has two individual Lanes, each with its own Battle Zone and minions.

| Player Count | Wave Counters | Life Counters |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| 6-8 Players | 2 x 7 | 6 |
| 9-10 Players | 2 x 7 | 7 |

- "The Battle Zone" on cards means "a Battle Zone"
- Minions are bound to their original Battle Zone for respawning
- Minion Battles resolved separately but simultaneously
- After last Wave counter on either Lane: team with more total Zones between their Throne and both Battle Zones wins
