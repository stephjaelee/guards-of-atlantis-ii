## How to Read Card Entries

Each card is shown in a table with the following columns:

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Init** | Initiative value — determines turn order (higher goes first) |
| **Card Name** | The name of the card |
| **Secondary** | Secondary action values: D = Defense, M = Movement |
| **Primary** | Primary action type and value (e.g., "4 Attack-Ranged 2") |
| **Tier** | Card tier: Basic, H (Handicap), I, II, III, or IV (Ultimate) |
| **Item** | Item bonus gained when this card becomes an item (+ATK, +DEF, +INT, +MOV, +RNG, +RAD) |

**Card types:**
- **Basic** = Gold and Silver cards (signature moves, never upgraded)
- **H** = Handicap card (weaker version of a basic card)
- **I / II / III** = Non-basic card tiers (upgraded through leveling)
- **(!)** before Defense = Block-type defense (prevents the attack entirely rather than calculating defense value)

**Front Cards** and **Back Cards** refer to the two sides of the physical reference card sheets. Each hero's full card pool spans both sides.

Below each table, the full card text is listed for every card.
